Who:
When it comes to this topic, the first person who pops into my mind is (xxx), who is my neighbor and deeply impressed me with his (sense of humor, plenty of vigor, enthusiasm, compassion, and rich and fulfilling life， professional knowledge).

How:
The first time we met each other was in the mall, which is close to our block. When I wanted to pay, unfortunately, I found that I had forgotten to bring money. Just when I was very embarrassed, he recognized me and paid for me. So after several interactions, we gradually got to know much about each other.

(It's hard to imagine that an old man's life can be so exciting and fulfilling.) He is a very interesting person who likes reading, making handicrafts, and sports. (Although he is over 50 years old, he seems to have no idea what fatigue is.) He was also one of the sponsors of some organizations. After we became close friends, he often took me to various reading clubs and art exhibitions, which gradually enriched my life and broadened my horizons. Furthermore, he also took me to exercise, especially teaching me to swim, which was something I never dared to think about when I was a child because I was extremely afraid of water. But his encouragement and patient teaching helped me overcome my fear. To this day, I still make it a point to swim at least two to three times a week(with him) to maintain my(our) physical and mental well-being.

I see him more as a mentor than a （regular friend， , elder）. Without his help and encouragement(suggestion & advice), I probably wouldn't be where I am today and my life won't have so much fun, so I'm very grateful for his assistance(presence). I'm also very lucky to have a friend like him in my life.

who:
When it comes to this topic, the first person who pops into my mind is (xxx), who is a Robot Streamer and deeply impressed me with his (excellent skills and vast expertise).

How:
The first time I knew him was on the youtube, since he has been uploading videos about （robot knowledge） for the past few years. As I am also a （a big fan & robotics practitioner）, I am very interested in his videos and gradually knew much about him.

What:
He not only shares （cutting-edge robots made by other universities）, but he also （made a humanoid robot himself） and used videos to show （the excellent performance of the robot）, which caused a huge sensation on the Internet.

In the past two years, he started his own （robotics company） and attracted a lot of talented people who are interested in (robot). Even though he’s become more of a businessman now, he’s always been very hands-on with （research and development）, never just leaving everything to others. This really shows how passionate he is about the （industry）. Even now, I still see his comments on new （products） in （robotics forums）.

I see him more like a spiritual mentor than just a （video uploader）. Without (him as a role model), I probably wouldn’t be where I am today, so I’m really grateful for everything he’s shared with the community.

花费甚少的外出日
愉快的公共交通之旅

Where: When it comes to this topic, the first place that pops into my mind is (xxx), which is located in (xxx) and deeply impressed me with its excellent scenery.

How: At first, I didn’t know about this place. I was simply looking for somewhere to relax. By chance, I saw someone introduce this place on the Internet, which aroused my great interest.

When: I went to that place last year, as I was in a bad mood during that period because of some trivial matters. So, I often went to that peaceful place to relax, especially during lunchtime or on vacation.

Who: At first, I just went there with my best friend, but later, I often went with my colleagues after work. We all enjoyed the peaceful environment and atmosphere there, especially the fresh air, which is very difficult to find in the city.

What: We usually walked along the river and enjoyed the beautiful scenery. There were many small animals there, such as kittens, deer, and squirrels. We often brought some food and vegetables from home to feed the small animals. Sometimes, we would just find a place to sit down, rest, and chat.

Why: The reason I recommend visiting this place is that I believe people today spend too much time in the city. Most of our daily lives are consumed by commuting and working, leaving little time to appreciate nature. Visiting places like this regularly can offer a refreshing break, allowing us to temporarily escape the stresses of city life and refresh our minds. When we are here, we feel completely disconnected from the hustle and bustle of the city and fully immersed in nature. This relaxing experience is beneficial for both our physical and mental well-being.

How you feel: I see this place as a place that can purify the soul, rather than just an ordinary park. If I couldn’t go to such a place, I think my life would lack a lot of joy. It would also be difficult for me to have similar opportunities to connect with nature.
