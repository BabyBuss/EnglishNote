Some countries spend a lot of money preparing competitors to take part in major competitions such as Olympic Games or football World Cup. Some people say that it would be better to spend this money encouraging children to take up sports from a young age.  

To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

答案：

Some people think it's not reasonable that some countries comsume a lot of money to subsidize their offical competitors to attend the large competitions like Olympic Games or football World Cup instead of young children to take part in sports in their early stage. Although it's important to cultivate the children in sports as soon as possible, I disagree with the idea that shifting these money from athletes to children.

On the one hand, it's necessary for children to have a role model  to learn in ther daily life.  For instance, the famous athletes like Yao Ming and James embodied good sportsmanships in the basketball field, which greatly encouraged the children to participate in this sport and arouse a great deal of passion among it's young fans. No one can doubt their significant influence and we have to acknowledge that there is no substitute for that influence, even though a lot of money. So, countries spend a lot of money preparing competitors to take part in major competitions is reasonable.

On the other hand,  the existence of these competitors help our human to explore our limitations. The chief purpose of Olympics games is more faster, more higher and more strengthen. With these people's endeavor, we proved that our human have infinite potential ability. Otherwise, their competitions are very attractive and many people have a mania for watching their good performance.They attract lots of commercial investment and large organizations like NBA can thrive and recruit more and more youngsters.

In conclusion, although I have to admit that spending money on helping children in the aspect of sport is important, I think subsidizing athletes by country is more necessary.

bing ai润色：

Some argue that the substantial funding allocated to training athletes for global events like the Olympics or the World Cup should be redirected towards encouraging children to participate in sports from a young age. While nurturing youth sports is important, reducing financial support for professional athletes would not be beneficial.

Firstly, elite athletes serve as crucial role models, inspiring younger generations. Figures like Usain Bolt and Serena Williams  showcase the value of perseverance, discipline, and hard work. Their global achievements spark enthusiasm among children to engage in sports and aspire to similar success. If countries were to decrease their investment in these athletes, the visibility and influence of such icons would diminish, reducing their ability to motivate young people.

Moreover, professional athletes bring significant economic and social benefits to their countries. International competitions attract substantial commercial investments, including sponsorships and media rights, generating revenue that can be reinvested in grassroots sports programs. The success of national athletes fosters unity and pride among citizens, encouraging broader participation in physical activities. This creates a ripple effect, indirectly supporting youth sports development.

In conclusion, while promoting youth sports is essential, sustained investment in professional athletes is equally vital. These athletes inspire future generations, contribute to the economic and social well-being of their nations, and push the limits of human potential. Therefore, it is reasonable for countries to support elite athletes while also fostering youth engagement in sports.

答案：

Some argue that parents greatly influence their child's life, but influence from exterior environment makes much more impact on child's future. While the external influence we accepted can remarkably vary our development, I totally disagree with the idea that environment factors are more important than parent's effect.

Firstly, there is no denying that nothing can replace parent's love and education. Since the children were born, they have taught the children not only in words but in deeds. They transmit their characteristics to the children, which has a deterministic effect on children's destiny. For instance, the child is most probably being an academic as long as his father is a professor. The main reasion is that the gesture has more eloquent than any words his father could have spoken. 

Moreover, parents are one of those who accompany the longest time with children in their lifelong, especially during their childhood period. Therefore they can rectify children's harmful habit before it's too late, no matter what kind of that. So necessary is parent's effect that there is no substitute for this, even through external factors. The famous chinese traditional story named "Being yourself" introduces that there was boy lived in countryside with a dream of being a celebrity. His neighborhoods mocked at his ambition, but he still got great success in movie field due to his mother's constently encourage and inspire. So we could not belittle the importance of parent's influence.

In conclusion, while external factors plays a notable role in children's development, I am still in a hundred agreement with the idea that parent's influence is more important.

Some argue that parents greatly influence their child's life, but external environmental factors have a larger impact on their future. While it is true that external influences can play a significant role in shaping a child’s development, I firmly disagree with the view that they are more important than parental influence.

Firstly, it is undeniable that nothing can replace the love and education provided by parents. From the moment children are born, parents not only teach them through words but also lead by example. Parents often pass on their values, habits, and characteristics to their children, which can have a profound effect on their future. For instance, if a child's father is an academic, the child is more likely to develop a strong interest in education. **This influence stems from the actions of the father, which speak louder than words.**

Moreover, parents are the ones who spend the most time with their children, particularly during the formative years of childhood. **This constant presence allows parents to correct any negative behaviors before they become ingrained.** A well-known Chinese story, for example, tells of a boy from a rural area who aspired to become a movie star. Despite being ridiculed by his neighbors, he achieved great success in the film industry thanks to the unwavering support and encouragement from his mother. This illustrates the irreplaceable role of parental guidance.

In conclusion, although external factors certainly contribute to a child's development, I strongly believe that parental influence is far more important. Parents provide the foundation upon which a child builds their values, habits, and future success.

While some argue that there is no necessity for children to learn handwriting in today's digital society, I completely disagree with this view and strongly believe in the importance of preserving handwriting skills.

Firstly, handwriting inherited from our ancestors is a form of art that accounts for a significant portion of our historical heritage. The more we study and preserve this precious heritage, the more deeply we can understand the knowledge and culture of our history. Through a thorough understanding of handwriting, the process of recovering old books and documents has been significantly expedited, thereby sparing researchers the challenge of navigating historical uncertainties.

Moreover, handwriting is an exceptional skill that can remarkably cultivate patience in children. With the advent of new pastimes, children are gradually not capable of taking a long time on matters which will significantly influence their future due to the lack of patience. Therefore, it's much better to correct this problem before it is ingrained. Although this purpose can be achieved by playing the piano, violin or learning other skills, there is another advantage that all other things do not possess, is the correlation with our own traditional culture.  

In conclusion, despite the fact that people may not consider handwriting essential in their daily lives, I strongly believe that learning handwriting during childhood is of paramount importance.

In today's digital era, while some argue that teaching children handwriting is unnecessary, I strongly believe in the importance of preserving this fundamental skill.

Firstly, handwriting, as an art inherited from our ancestors, represents a significant portion of our historical heritage. The more we study and preserve this precious heritage, the more deeply we can comprehend our historical knowledge and cultural traditions. A thorough understanding of handwriting has significantly expedited the process of recovering old books and documents, thus relieving researchers from the challenges of interpreting historical uncertainties.

Moreover, handwriting is an exceptional skill that can remarkably cultivate patience in children. With the advent of new pastimes, children are gradually losing the ability to focus on tasks that will significantly influence their future, primarily due to diminishing patience. Therefore, it's much better to correct this problem before it is ingrained. Although similar purposes can be achieved by learning musical instruments like the piano or violin, handwriting uniquely offers a direct connection to our traditional culture. 

In conclusion, despite the fact that people may not consider handwriting essential in their daily lives, I strongly believe that learning handwriting during childhood is of paramount importance.

While some argue that parents learn good educational skills can significantly reduce youth crime incidence, I strongly believe that there are other methods much better.

External environment factors, as a indispensable part of life, also play notable roles and greatly influence the children's future. The fact is that tons of people in this society tempt and deceive youngsters to do wrong things. The more times children contact with the strangers with bad motives, the higher of the possibility they commit crimes. Parents tried in vain to prevent their children against these bad people, even though they have tried their best and took a lot of steps, including learning parenting skills to perceive and correct children's problem before it's ingrained.

There are several methods that can remarkably decline the youth crime incidence. First, a lot of youngsters put in prison for theft, so government subsidizes the poor family's living is a good way to reduce the crime. When it comes to solving economic crime, parent's education a one thing, actural allowence quite another. Second, violence, as a primary portion of crime, often takes place in campus and stems from the ignorance of teachers. Some theachers do not have subtle perception on children's relationships, and then many violence crime between classmates ensue. 

In conclusion, despite the fact that parent's endeavor is necessary to protect their children against commiting crime, I firmly believe that other measurements are far more effective.

This issue can be explained in objective and subjective perspectives. On the one hand, with the advent of new technologies, a lot of electronic temptations like the Internet, video games and social softwares were invented, which significantly distract children's concentration and scatter their energy. These objective factors induce them even if during the school time and gradually impair their ability to move forward.

## 作文 环境类

### 真题19

Some professionals give the advice on solving the environmental problems by incresing the cost of fossil energy and cars. I totally disagree with this idea. There are seveal reasons why I disagree.

On the one hand, there is no denying that there are a lot of factors caused the environmental problems, like factory pollution, chemistry fluid, air pollution by hazardous gas, instead of just utilization of fossil fuels or vehicles. It's arbitrary to attribute the environmental problem to this reason. So, even if increasing the cost, the probelm could not be tackled. People should penerate the apperance and see the essence that there is no ohter way whereby we can resovle environmental problem but making holistic assessment and analysing the core of it.

On the other hand, if the government adopts this suggession, excessive inflation would be caused. We all know that modern industry is based on fuels and trucks. Moreover, transportation cost is usually the main cause of price surge. A tiny fluctuate of oil's price could result in a significantly knock-on effect on the whole country's economy. In worst case senerio, the economy could drop into recession, and then, many problems like retrenchment and unemployment may ensue.

In conclusion, even though some experts advise that people could increase the cost of oil and vehicles as a method to tackle the environmental problem. I am in a hundred disagreement with this idea and I think there are many other effective and efficient ways to make our natural environment be better except for this method.

gpt润色：

Some experts suggest that a solution to the environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuels and vehicles. I strongly disagree with this suggestion and believe that there are more effective methods to address environmental challenges without harming the economy.

On the one hand, it is important to recognize that environmental issues are caused by a wide range of factors, not *solely* by the use of fossil fuels and vehicles. Industries contribute significantly to pollution through factory emissions, chemical waste, and the release of hazardous gases. To attribute environmental damage solely to fuel consumption and vehicle use is overly simplistic. Therefore, even if the government were to increase fuel and vehicle costs, it would not fully address the root causes of environmental degradation. Instead, a comprehensive approach is needed, one that tackles all sources of pollution and addresses the core issues in a balanced manner.

On the other hand, raising the cost of fuels and vehicles could have severe economic consequences. The modern economy relies heavily on transportation and energy, meaning that even a small rise in fuel prices could lead to a surge in production and transport costs. This would likely cause a ripple effect throughout the economy, with prices for essential goods rising and inflation escalating. In the worst-case scenario, increased costs could lead to a recession, resulting in unemployment and financial hardship for many people. For instance, a higher cost of fuel may make it more expensive to transport goods, driving up prices and reducing people's purchasing power.

In conclusion, although some experts advocate for raising the cost of fuel and vehicles to combat environmental issues, I completely disagree with this approach. Instead, I believe that governments should prioritize investments in clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and enforce strict regulations on industrial pollution. These solutions would address environmental concerns more effectively without imposing financial burdens on individuals and the economy.

同桌英语范文：

Nowadays, various cities in the world are experiencing tremendous forms of environmental issues, one of which is aggravated pollution. Thus, in order to tackle this environmental challenge, governments suggest oil price hikes and vehicle price surges. I partly favor these suggestions.

On the one hand, I agree that by increasing the price of petrol, more people will be discouraged from driving their own private cars. **As a result**（替换therefore）, not only traffic congestion but also car emissions that worsen global warming will be reduced. For instance, studies show that some European countries that applied this ordinance witnessed a decrease in the presence of private vehicles on the roads but an increase in the utilization of public transportation. It helped the earth’s atmosphere recover ***as（可以替换since）*** there is dramatic reduction of smog and air pollution.

On the other hand, I must say that enlarging the cost of all types of vehicles is not **the optimum key**（替换important） to solving environmental difficulties; **in fact**（转折）, it creates even more problems for the greater public. For example, some individuals prefer to drive their own cars as public transportation is either scarce or inaccessible in their area. Some families also need vehicles **in case of** emergencies and other purposes. Therefore, placing a high price tag on all vehicles, particularly personal automobiles, will render(替换cause，和后面的with是固定搭配) these people with no or limited means to arrive at their destinations conveniently.

In conclusion, I honestly concur（替换agree） that increasing the price of petrol can be an effective factor to reduce the consumption of this energy and thereafter（替换therefore） mitigate（替换relieve） environmental hurdles（替换problem）. However, merely expanding the cost of private transportation will not effectively deal with environmental troubles（替换problem） but actually create more problems for society. Thus, a combination of measures should be taken into careful consideration by governments and individuals.


# 考场真题 17

Nowadays, the whole world is experencing tremendous forms of issues, one of which is the abuse of fossil fuels. Thus some argue that the authorieties should decline the fossil energy consumption as soon as possible. I partly favor this suggestion.

On the one hand, I agree that natural environment could be much better by reducing the use of fossil fuels, especially the air pollution could be significantly tackled. As a result, people not only enjoy the pure air and cleaning atmosphere but possess physical well-being as they don't have to be damaged by those  toxins.  For instance, the London government replaced the fuel buses by the electric ones, which greatly decreased the incidence of lung diseases in a couple of years. There is no denying about the effectiveness of this policy. After that, as the use of cleaning energy increases, residents' longevity is gradually being prolonged.

On the other hand, I must say that there is no other way whereby we can deal with the shortage of fossil fuels except for reducing the use of that. As one of the fossil fuels, oil plays a notable role in modern industry and is renowned as the "blood" of industry. WIthout this necessary material, many products like plastic could not be produced even if scientists try their best. However, we all know that although these materials are indispensable, the truth is fossil energy is not sustainable. So we have no choice but saving them.

In conclusion, I honestly concur that reducing the use of fossil fuels can cause a terrible inflation in aspect of our daily necessities. However, in order to make sure our offsprings have a bright future, it's our responsibility to immediately reduce the fossil fuels' consumption.
