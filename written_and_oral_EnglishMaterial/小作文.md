Line chart illustrates the percentage of cinema attendance in the UK among four different age groups (14-24, 24-34, 34-44 and 44-54) from 1990 to 2010.

Overall, cinema attendance increased <u>**across all age groups**</u> over the given time period, although there was a noticeable decline around 2000. Movie attendance was consistently highest in the 44-54 age group, while the 14-24 group saw the lowest attendance <u>**throughout the years**</u>.

Cinema attendance gradually increased across all age groups between 1990 and 1995, with the 44-54 age group retaining the highest proportion, at approximately 50 percent. However, in 2000, audience numbers fell across all age groups, with significant declines of around 5% in the 24-34 and 34-44 age groups, especially in the 14-24 age group, <u>**which reached below 15%**</u>.

This was followed by a sharp recovery in 2005 among younger age groups (14-24 and 24-34 years old), and a steady increase among older age groups (34-44 and 44-54 years old). In contrast to the sharp resurgence among younger audiences, attendance among the 14-24 and 24-34 age groups remained stable after 2005. By 2010, the gap between younger and older groups was growing.

Given is a line **chart** that compares various **age ranges** in terms of their visits to movie theaters in the United Kingdom **in a period spanning two decades**.

Generally, the percentage of moviegoers from all ages **experienced the same change inclinations**, despite some minor fluctuations. Furthermore, most of the **individuals** who watched in cinemas were aged 44-54, whilst the lowest attendance rates **belonged to** those aged under 24.

In 1990, there were similar proportions of people aged 34 to 44 and 44 to 54 who went to cinemas, both at roughly 35%. Regarding those of 24-34 and 14-24-year-olds, their attendance rates were much lower, which were approximately 25% and 15%, successively.

In the first 10 years, oscillations of differing extents could be observed in the figures for all groups, but all of them climbed by 10% or thereabouts between 2000 and 2005. However, by 2010, the percentages of viewers 44 to 54 and 34 to 44 years old continued to go up, reaching nearly 51% and 44%, respectively. Compared to that, those of the others primarily remained constant, at 33% or so for audience members aged 24 to 34 and almost 21% for those 14 to 24 years old.

The linear graphs illustrate the average temperature and mean hours of everyday sunshine in two popular coastal areas in Australia, namely, Melbourne and Darwin.

Overall, both Melbourne and Darwin manifest similar tendencies of rises and falls in temperature throughout the year. In terms of sunshine hours, **the two cities display completely different patterns, with one increasing while the other decreases.**

Starting with the first chart, Melbourne’s temperature is lower than Darwin’s at the beginning of the year, with figures of 6 and 18, respectively. Both numbers **continuously increase as the months pass, peaking in July at 18 degrees in Melbourne and reaching the highest in Darwin during August, with temperatures of 30 degrees.** **Another notable feature is that** both cities’ temperature **plummets** **toward the end of the year**; that is, Darwin’s temperature **stands at** 24 and Melbourne’s at **an approximate of** 8.

Meanwhile, Melbourne is **sunnier with ten hours of sun rays in January than Darwin with six hours**, but they similarly experience eight hours of sunshine in March and roughly nine sunny hours in mid-November. **Noticeably**, Darwin is more exposed to the sun from June to September (circa eleven hours) than Melbourne (six hours); however, by December, the former declines by roughly 3 hours, whereas the latter goes back to its original figure.

The line graph illustrates the average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per person in four countries—the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal—over a 40-year period from 1967 to 2007.

Overall, the United Kingdom consistently **had the highest emissions throughout the period, despite a steady decline**. Sweden also experienced a significant decrease after an initial rise. In contrast, Italy and Portugal both saw a gradual increase in emissions **over the same time frame.**

In 1967, the UK had the highest level of CO2 emissions, approximately 11 metric tonnes per person, and this steadily decreased over the next four decades, falling to around 9 metric tonnes in 2007. Sweden initially followed a different pattern, with emissions rising sharply to a peak of about 10.5 metric tonnes in 1977 before plummeting to approximately 5 metric tonnes by 2007.

Meanwhile, Italy and Portugal both started with relatively low emissions in 1967, at around 4 and 1 metric tonnes, respectively. Italy’s emissions steadily increased, surpassing Sweden by the mid-1980s and reaching nearly 8 metric tonnes by 2007. Similarly, Portugal saw a consistent rise, with its emissions growing from 1 to 5.5 metric tonnes by the end of the period, meeting Sweden’s level by 2007.

<!-- In summary, while the UK and Sweden experienced reductions in their CO2 emissions over the years, Italy and Portugal followed a trend of increasing emissions, with Portugal showing the most rapid growth. -->

The bar charts compare the data of a bus company in America over a given period from 1999 to 2003.

It's clear that the portion of buses actually arrived on time is higher than company's target approximately over all five years. Meanwhile, the number of complains from passengers gradually increased.

In 1999, the proportion of actural and target performance both reached their own's peak, which reached above 80% respectively. From then on, there was a sharp drop and these two figure in 2000 were almost one-second of those in 1999. After 2000, these two figure remained stable until 2023. At that point, a significant raise in actural performance took place, with an increase of around 40%, was around two times as much as that in 2002 and target performance in 2003.

In terms of number of complains, the number continued to show an upward trend though the years and reached its highest point around 120.

The bar charts illustrate the performance of a bus company's on-time arrivals compared to its target and the number of passenger complaints from 1999 to 2003 in America.

Overall, it is evident that actual on-time performance **generally exceeded** the company’s target throughout the five-year period. However, passenger complaints increased steadily over the years.

In 1999, both the actual and target on-time arrival rates peaked at over 80%. Following this, there was a sharp decline in 2000, with both metrics dropping to nearly half of their previous values. From 2001 to 2002, both actual and target performance remained relatively stable. However, in 2003, there was a substantial improvement in the actual on-time rate, rising by around 40% compared to 2002, almost doubling the target performance for that year.

As for passenger complaints, the number continued to rise consistently across the years, reaching its peak at approximately 120 in 2003.
